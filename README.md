# Agricultural Business Concepts

## Overview
### About
This is an e-commerce application that allows Nigerians to purchase agric products from a farm based in Ilorin, Nigeria. 

This was a project that was given to me by my employer (the owner of the farm) to develop for their business.


### Product Features
1. User Authentication - (Login / Signup)
2. Creation of products
3. Update of products
4. Deletion of products
5. Cart functionality
6. Wishlist Functionality
7. Payment feature using Flutterwave API
8. Route protection using Higher Order Components (HOCs)
7. Admin access control


### Technology Stack
This application was built using a mixture of TypeScript, NextJS and Redux on the frontend, and NodeJS on the backend and MySQL as the RDBMS. 

### Challenges
It was quite challenging to implement TypeScript as I had not used it prior to working on this project.

I hope to add more sophisticated features in the future like live order tracking, analytics, automated responses and a chatbot.
